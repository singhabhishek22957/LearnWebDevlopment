/*
Create a javascript program that takes in two numbers and a string operator. Make use of a switch statement 
to perform the operation on the two numbersK
The calculator function should:
| Take in two numbers, num1 and num2, and a string representing a mathematical operator, operatorJ
| Use a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the value of the operatorJ
| If the operator is one of the four valid operators (+, -, *, /), perform the corresponding mathematical 
operation and store the result in a variable called resultJ
| If the operator is not one of the valid operators, log "Invalid operator" to the consoleK
